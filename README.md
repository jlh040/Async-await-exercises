### Deck of Cards and Number Facts (refactored with async/await)

- These exercises are refactored versions of the [deck of cards exercise](https://github.com/jlh040/JS-Promises-Part2) and the [number facts exercise](https://github.com/jlh040/JS-Promises-Exercise).
- Note that those exercises were made using only JavaScript promises; however, these two versions use the cleaner async/await keywords.
- See the original exercises for instructions on how to run these on your computer.
